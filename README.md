# ReddiKnowDense: Detecting Signs of Mental Illness from Reddit Comments
### Summary
- This project contains an End-To-End Machine Learning pipeline for the fine tuning of the large language model RoBERTa for text classification.
- It is fine tuned via adding an MLP (Feed-Forward) network to the output of the current network, as well as a Convolutional Neural Network. (RoBERTa-MLP, RoBERTa-CNN)
- These models are then combined with zero, one and few shot learning from GPT 3.5.
