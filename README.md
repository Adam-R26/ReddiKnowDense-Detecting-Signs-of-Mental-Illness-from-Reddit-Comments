# ReddiKnowDense: Detecting Signs of Mental Illness from Reddit Comments
### Summary
- This project develops an <b>end-to-end machine learning pipeline</b> that leverages the advanced capabilities of RoBERTa, a large language model, for text classification.
- The model is <b>fine-tuned using two distinct classification heads</b>: a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), labeled as RoBERTa-MLP and RoBERTa-CNN, respectively.
- This approach allows for a <b>comparative analysis of these methods with GPT 3.5's in-context learning capabilities</b>, focusing on <b>identifying potential mental illness indicators in Reddit comments</b>, a novel real world problem.
- Along the way, the <b>power behind the transformer architecture</b> will be discussed in a way to make it understandable to the masses. My goal here is to <b>help people struggling to get to grips with modern NLP techinques, gain a more intuitive understanding of why these methods are so effective</b> rather than just using them as a so called black box.

### Approach
#### Data Acquisition and Pre-Processing
